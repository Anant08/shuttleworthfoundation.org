                      We  would like to live in an open knowledge society with limitless possibilities for all. To help us get there, we identify amazing people with innovative ideas, give them a fellowship grant, and multiply  the money they put into their own project by a factor of ten or more.

If we are deliberate about finding great people, supporting and  sharing their positive approaches for social change,  the world will get better, faster.  That is why we are looking for social  innovators who are open at heart, have a fresh perspective on addressing challenges and have a very clear idea of their role in bringing about positive change.

    <p>
        The holy grail of every funder is sustainability, an idea and approach living long after the money has run out. That is why we fund people not projects. The only true way to sustainability is not a business plan but a champion, someone who will drive an idea through an ever changing landscape, to make a real difference in the world.
