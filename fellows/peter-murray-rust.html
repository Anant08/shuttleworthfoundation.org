					<p>Peter Murray-Rust is a scientist who wants to make scientific information available to everyone, and to make it useful. Machines are a key part of this so he has developed semantic tools which read the literature, extract, validate and republish science. Peter believes that many others share this vision which will grow through bottom-up communities. One such is the <a target="_blank"  href="http://www.blueobelisk.org">Blue Obelisk</a> which has developed many Free/Open programs in chemistry.</p>
					<p>The major challenge is not technical, but entrenched attitudes and vested interests. Peter challenges this, both on his blog and by writing “liberation software” to be used by everyone. His current project “The Content Mine” aims to liberate vast numbers of facts currently hidden in the scientific literature and to publish them immediately. The software is generalisable to any discipline, but the first examples will be in biodiversity and in chemistry. He intends to spread the idea by running workshops and hackdays for everyone &ndash; policy makers, researchers, developers and will be looking for others to develop their own fields and plugins.</p>
