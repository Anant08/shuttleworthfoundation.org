Medicines save lives. Unfortunately the right to profit often overrides the right to access. Fake innovation, manifested in bad patents, harms humanity: it blocks affordable versions of life-saving drugs and impedes real innovation. Too often, the cost of bad intellectual property is the price of life.

Achal Prabhala is determined to change this. As a thoughtful and strategic advocate for intellectual property reform and access to medicines, Achal challenges the legal and policy frameworks that underpin the global development and manufacture of medicines in order to improve access and innovation. The focus of his fellowship is to [defend](http://blogs.wsj.com/indiarealtime/2015/03/19/inside-india-indias-fight-against-big-pharma-patents-is-a-just-war/) existing pro-access initiatives against onslaughts from private interests, and [extend](http://www.healthgap.org/op_ed_what_patent_reform_in_brazil_and_south_africa_can_mean) their global reach, especially within India, South Africa and Brazil.
