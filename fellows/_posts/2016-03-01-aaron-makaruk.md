Aaron Makaruk is developing methodologies, tools and kits for integrating natural agricultural and ecological systems with urban environments in order to restore balance to food production and consumption cycles. These include [AKER's](http://docs.aker.me/) simple garden kits that snap together without tools in just minutes and can be adjusted to fit even the smallest balcony.

We are excited about working with Aaron on the consumers to creators process. Access to information about the food we eat, its origin and the resources that go into production is essential to building global food security. AKER kits are the beginning of implementing this much larger vision, encouraging hands on engagement. At the same time it is an experiment in the commercialisation of open design in a fresh area for the Foundation.
