Daniel's primary interest is Crowdcrafting and its underlying software PyBossa, a citizen science framework that allows and supports citizens and researchers to create citizen science projects and gather collaborative communities around them, using volunteer sensing, computing and thinking.

We support Daniel because we believe that science is not for ivory towers, it is for real people making sense of the world.
