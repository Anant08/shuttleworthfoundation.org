Tiffiniy Cheng is stepping up to call regular citizens to action around web freedom. Through [Fight for the Future](https://www.fightforthefuture.org/) she is developing innovative, scalable organising approaches that are centered around the creative use of technology, messaging and alliance-building. Their purpose is to defend online human rights and the open web using the very nature of the Internet - collaboration between distributed nodes.

Having  participated in a number of her campaigns before, we are eager to get a  behind the scenes look. Digital freedom is a concept still alien to  many, even regular, users of the web. The result is a lack of  understanding or appreciation of potential threats, and therefore garners apathetic  responses at best. Now is the time to ensure that human rights are  reflected in the digital world as they are in the physical. Working with  Tiffiniy and Fight for the Future gives us the opportunity to be  integrally involved in and directly support positive action.
