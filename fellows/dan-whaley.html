                   		As a society we face a diverse set of urgent threats across multiple sectors – environmental, economic, humanitarian, political, and many others. What is common across these challenges is the need for reliable information to back personal and ultimately civic decisions and to inform mainstream support of policy choices – reliable information that we currently lack. This deficit creates a lag between our detection of issues that demand our attention and our effective response to them – with potentially devastating consequences.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    	Dan’s thesis is that our lack of access to quality information, or our disagreement about it, and our inability to adopt effective policies as a result, are primarily responsible for this lag – and that addressing this is critical to our convergence on solutions to innumerable derivative issues. He believes strongly that if we are to achieve sustainability as a species we must solve this.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    	He wants to transform how we know what’s credible in the world around us–by creating infrastructure to enable the crowdsourced peer-review of information everywhere.
