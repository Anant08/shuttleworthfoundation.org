					<p>Steve Vosloo is 21st Century Learning Fellow at the Shuttleworth Foundation, tackling the challenges that face South Africa from an education perspective. Steve’s specific interest is the use of mobile phones in literacy development.</p>
                    <p>He began his career as a web developer, working in both Johannesburg and London during the dot-com boom. Since moving back to South Africa he has developed a passion for the use of information and communication technologies (ICTs) for socio-economic development. Steve was the Design and Usability Team Leader at the Centre for e-Innovation for the Provincial Government of the Western Cape and ensured that the award-winning <a href="http://www.capegateway.gov.za/eng/your_gov/14311" target="_blank">Cape Gateway portal</a> was as usable and accessible to as many citizens of the Western Cape as possible. He has also presented at numerous UN conferences on e-government, local digital content and youth and ICTs. Steve has a Masters degree in Information Systems from the <a href="http://www.uct.ac.za/" target="_blank">University of Cape Town</a> and recently completed a one-year <a href="http://rdvp.org/" target="_blank">Research Fellowship</a> at Stanford University, where he researched youth and digital media.</p>
                    <p>Steve’s hobbies include traveling; from weekends in the Western Cape to any form of far-flung international travel. Steve’s <a href="http://vosloo.net/" target="_blank">blog</a> contains his thoughts and findings along the journey to research and promote Communication and Analytical Skills in South African schools.</p>
