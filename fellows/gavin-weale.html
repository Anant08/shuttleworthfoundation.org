					<p>Gavin is an award-winning social entrepreneur and publisher from the UK. He has spent a large part of his career working alongside two of the UK’s leading social entrepreneurs, Sam Conniff and Michelle Clothier at Livity UK, the London-based youth engagement specialists.</p>
                    <p>Originally from a journalism background, Gavin led the development of the Live Magazine project for Livity over ten years, transforming a small local youth zine into a nationwide print and digital media channel that is 100% created by young people. He led successful bids for major European Social Fund (2004) and Home Office Preventing Violent Extremism funding (2008), the latter leading to the opening of a second Live Magazine in east London aimed at engaging disaffected young Muslims.</p>
                    <p>As an Associate Director of Livity, Gavin played a key role in developing and designing pitches and projects including Live Insight for BBC Three (innovative co-created digital consumer insight), nationwide Olympics Legacy programme somewhereto_ (which campaigned for unlocking unused spaces for youth development), as well as social marketing campaigns for DFID, Coca-Cola &amp; O2.</p>
                    <p>In 2010 Gavin won the UK Young Publishing Entrepreneur Award for his work on Live Magazine, which brought him to South Africa, leading to the development of the idea to replicate the project in South Africa. In early 2011, he was awarded a prestigious Shuttleworth Foundation Fellowship, and moved to Cape Town.</p>
                    <p>He has since been responsible for launching Livity Africa as a social enterprise, with Live Magazine SA as its primary focus. In two and a half years, Live Mag SA has printed and published nine issues of the youth-produced magazine, which is aimed at training and springboarding its contributors into work (with a success rate at over 50%), whilst distributing crucial peer-led content to a mass audience. In August 2012 Live SA was officially rated as the highest circulating youth publication in SA. Live’s mobile channel launched in May 2012, and the magazine included brand partnerships with Google, Metropolitan, Coca-Cola &amp; Red Bull.</p>
                    <p>In 2013 Gavin was awarded a third year of Shuttleworth Fellowship, and launched of a new office in Johannesburg in partnership with the British Council and Connect ZA, overseeing a series of live music events and creative networking sessions. In 2014, Livity Africa has launched a major democratic engagement campaign via its channels with funding from Omidyar, as well as a digital skills accelerator programme in partnership with Google.</p>
