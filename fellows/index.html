                    The Shuttleworth Foundation Fellowship Program funding consists of two components for each Fellow – the fellowship grant and the co-investment project funding.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    The fellowship grant covers the cost of the Fellow’s time for a year and is guaranteed to the fellow for that year. The grant amount varies and is determined by each Fellow’s salary equivalent outside of the fellowship.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    The co-investment project funding is the most unique part of the Fellowship Program, as Fellows are rewarded for investing in their own ideas. An amount of $250,000 is set aside per Fellow per year as potential project funding. This funding is unlocked through a light weight project pitch process and the Foundation tops up the Fellow’s own investment by adding at least 10 times as much funding from their project funding pool.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Imagine the cost of a Fellow’s time for the year is agreed at $1000. As the fellowship year progresses, the Fellow realises that it would be beneficial to spend $100 in order to advance their idea. The Fellow then takes $900 home for the cost of her time and reinvests $100 back into the implementation of her idea, while the Foundation contributes at least another $1000, giving her a project budget of $1100.
                    <p>
                    <strong>The investment coming partly from the Fellow themselves has a 2-fold effect;</strong>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Fellows are rewarded for the time and money they would typically invest in their own ideas as a free agent anyway by focusing their time and amplifying their funding.</li>
                        <li>Fellows pay closer attention to the relationship between expenses and outcomes.</li>
                    </ol>
