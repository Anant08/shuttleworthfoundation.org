Francois is passionate about advancing Open Science, specifically Citizen Cyberscience. Citizen cyberscience is a collective term for a diverse, grass-roots movement that is enabling ordinary citizens to participate in real scientific research thanks to the Web.

Citizen cyberscience is social networking with a purpose. It turns science education into a highly motivating participative activity.
