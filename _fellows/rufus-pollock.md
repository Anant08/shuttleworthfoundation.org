Rufus is working to promote open knowledge around the world, including any kind of content or data from sonnets to statistics, genes to geodata, which is freely usable, sharable and reusable.

Specifically he promotes open knowledge in different domains such as governmental, scientific, economic and bibliographic. This involves working to build communities of advocates and practitioners â€“ by organising regular meetings, bringing people together for events and starting work on standards and consensus building. Building and sustaining independent and active communities of people creating, using, and promoting open data in different fields is key to advancing open knowledge around the world.
