Sean is working on Safecast, building open hardware, open source software and open systems to empower people with data about their environment, and the tools to both collect and independently verify that data. The initial focus is radiation levels, with the intent to expand into air quality over time.

We support Sean because everyone should have access to the most reliable, up to date information about the environment in which they live. This project enables that by developing, and quality assuring, open hardware sensing tools and gathering the data to support better decision making at all levels.
