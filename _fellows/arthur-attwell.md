Arthur's mission is to make reading accessible to all. His fellowship was spent working on Paperight, a rights clearing house and enabler of distributed printing of books that might not otherwise be available to potential readers. His experiment included using copy shops as print on demand booksellers.

We support Arthur because access to books is essential for both formal and informal learning. While digital access shows promise, it is not yet universal and has some of the same challenges faced by print - distribution and legal access.
