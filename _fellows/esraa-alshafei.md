Esra'a is driving CrowdVoice, a primary source of synthesized and contextualized information on social dissent, that meets the information needs of various audiences in the most digestible way possible, enhanced by MyCrowdVoice, a reusable platform that enables others to do the same.

We support Esra'a and her work because unfettered access to authentic voices of dissent is essential to getting those voices out, building understanding and sparking action beyond their own reach.
