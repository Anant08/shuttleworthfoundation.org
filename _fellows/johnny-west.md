Johnny focuses his efforts on OpenOil, to establish public understanding of contractual relationships within the oil and mining industries. His work includes GaiaBase, an openly licensed geospatial database listing all natural resources on the planet and the pertaining physical, economic and legal data.

We support Johnny because the inner workings of the extractive industries are incredibly hidden, yet have enormous impact on our lives. Shining a light can only help create a more equitable, sustainable world.
