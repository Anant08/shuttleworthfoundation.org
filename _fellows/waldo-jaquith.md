Waldo is the founder of [US Open Data](https://www.usopendata.org/). His goal is to support the US government, at all levels, to release useful, usable open data, and to help both the private and public sector realise the benefits of open data over time.

We support Waldo because, while his focus is on unlocking data from the supply side, he also has keen insight into how open data can then benefit users on the demand side. Waldo's work will give us some insight into the "so what" of open government data.
