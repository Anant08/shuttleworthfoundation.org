##The three pillars of our theory of change are innovation, openness and living out loud.

We fund innovation, exploration and early stage implementation. The implementation of proven ideas is important, but there is a great deal of support for these kinds of initiatives already. We want to give the person with the fresh idea a chance to try it and see if it brings about the positive change they  believe it will. Conventional thinking takes a great deal of time and effort to shift and often radical alternatives are needed to bring about change.

We use open licenses which allow others to reuse, remix, adapt, improve, translate, redistribute, bring to scale, spread and build upon what we and our fellows have done. We then live out loud, sharing our thinking and findings and asking questions as we go. 

Once others are able to have insight into our work in this way, it opens the door for engagement and unexpected opportunities for collaboration from previously unknown places. Our work may find applications we could not imagine and spark ideas well beyond our current reach.
Thanks.
