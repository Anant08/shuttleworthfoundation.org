Paul is making the open-source Serval Project the premier mesh telephony platform, thus empowering individuals and communities to meet their own telecommunications needs, and to maintain telecommunications capacity when infrastructure is unavailable or unaffordable.

He hopes that this will help connect the last billion to affordable telephony, and the last five and a half billion to the internet, and thus narrow the digital-divide.
