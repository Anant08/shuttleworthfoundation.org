Marcin is passionate about creating the open source economy. He is currently working on the Global Village Construction Set (GVCS), a modular, open source platform that allows for the easy fabrication of the 50 industrial machines that it takes to build a small civilization with modern comforts.

As founder of Open Source Ecology, Marcin is building the next economy – an economy that optimizes both production and distribution – while providing environmental regeneration and social justice.
