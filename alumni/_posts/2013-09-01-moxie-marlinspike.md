Moxie's focus is Open Whisper Systems, developing frictionless applications for secure communication, aimed at end users and providing an overall experience that is better than the non-secure defaults. Available applications include TextSecure, RedPhone and Flock.

We support Moxie because as individuals we should all be able to share our thoughts and feelings, actions and ideas with those we choose, without fear of surveillance or judgement.
