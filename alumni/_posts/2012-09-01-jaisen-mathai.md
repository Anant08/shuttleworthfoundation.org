Jaisen recognises the importance of preserving media for posterity, be that personal or societal. His fellowship focus was Trovebox, a web service and open source software that facilitated the easy archiving and affordable storage of photos and videos without vendor lock in.

We support this because by not paying proper attention to the preservation of media assets, we are disposing so easily of our history, bit by bit. This erodes our ability to take stock of who we are and where we came from.
