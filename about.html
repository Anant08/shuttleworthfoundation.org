                        The Shuttleworth  Foundation is an innovative non-profit organisation that provides funding for dynamic leaders who are at the forefront of social change.  We identify amazing people, give them a fellowship grant, and multiply  the money they put into their projects by a factor of ten or more. We  are looking for social innovators who are helping to change the world  for the better and are looking for some support through an innovative  social investment model. The Foundation is at its core an experiment in  open philanthropy and uses alternative funding methodologies, new  technologies and collaborative ways of working to ensure that every  initiative receives the best exposure and resources to succeed.

                    	We envisage an open knowledge society with limitless possibilities  and innovation. Open Knowledge is a term used to denote a set of  principles and methodologies related to the production and distribution  of knowledge goods in an open manner. Knowledge is open if one is free  to use, reuse, and redistribute it without legal, social or  technological restriction. In this sense Open Knowledge can be seen as  being a superset of Open Data, Open Content, Open Access and Open  Source.

                    	Mark Shuttleworth started the Foundation in 2001.  Known for testing  boundaries in every sphere he becomes involved in, Mark continues to  drive change in the world through the Foundation. The Foundation prides  itself in investing in initiatives and individuals who challenge the  status quo and positively contribute to change.
